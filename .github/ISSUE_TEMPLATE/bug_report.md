<!-- To continue,  you will need to provide some elements
including a description of a [MINIMUM REPRODUCIBLE EXAMPLE][1] (MRE).  

The instructions on HOW to report MRE bugs can be found here:

  https://joaotavora.github.io/eglot/#Troubleshooting-Eglot

Here are GOOD examples of recent MRE bug reports:

  https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/1062
  https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/1037
  https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/940

If you don't have those elements, please DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT
CREATE AN BUG REPORT ISSUE. Creating an incomplete bug report issue
DOES NOT bring more attention to your problem, in fact quite the
contrary.

I you want to just want to talk about a problem, suggest a feature,
etc you can:

* Start a discussion at
  https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/discussions, where you may just
  speak your mind without any templates.  
  
* Start a discussion in Emacs' tracker via `M-x report-emacs-bug`.
  Alternatively, send email to `bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org`.  Be sure to
  `CC:` (or better, `X-Debbugs-CC:` ) Eglot's maintainer, currently
  `joaotavora@gmail.com`.
